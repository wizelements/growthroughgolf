    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I believe golf is more than a sport—it's a reflection of life and growth. Like gardening, you reap what you sow. You don’t fail until you stop trying. My instruction emphasizes patience, effort, and character. I meet each student where they are and help them grow with intention.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Assessment Approach</h2>
    <p>I assess student progress using both observation and data, with a focus on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Target precision and control</li>
      <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> How body movement aligns with results</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Repeatability of swing and posture</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Belief and focus under challenge</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Life Skills Through Golf</h2>
    <p>Golf teaches emotional control, responsibility, and resilience. These qualities are integrated into each session through creative games, self-reflection, and intentional feedback.</p>
    <p class="quote">“Golf is a quiet teacher. It teaches you to breathe, think, and try again.”</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Transferrable Coaching Experience</h2>
    <p>As a gymnastics coach at KidsGymUSA, I work with children as young as walking age up to 12 years old. I bring movement education, energy, and structure to every lesson. I know how to build trust, maintain engagement, and teach through body awareness and rhythm—all of which enhance my golf instruction style.</p>
